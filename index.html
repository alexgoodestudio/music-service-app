          Promineo Music is a songwriter app that generates a combination of songs,
          and genres that challenge you to create abstract versions of existing songs and see what can be brought out of them.
          The goal of Promineo Music is to help songwriters think outside of the box.
          By pairing combinations of genres, and song titles, we challenge songwriters
          to strengthen their songwriting creativity by reimagining new approaches to existing songs.
          Why do this? <br>
          <br>
          The next step is where it truly comes in handy. <span class="bold">The goal is to see how you can take this
          newly rendered cover, and develop it into
          a song of your own.</span> This is a technique that songwriters have been using
          since the beginning of music. Wash, Rinse, and Repeat. <br><br>
          
          <span class="bold">Promineo Music</span> encourages it's users
          to then challenge the next user by leaving a song and genre combination of their
          choice. In the below text box you can add a song and genre, which will then be added
          to the list below.
